### Evaluation Methodology:

We will use the following criteria while evaluating your code. Every criterion we state is important and will add to your overall score. However do not get stuck if you have hard times fulfilling a particular criterion. 
Notice that you are being evaluated in different aspects of your code and an unfinished or badly designed project is still better than nothing. We are aware that no code can be perfect and there is always room for improvement.
    
- #### `1.` Business Level Scoring
    - How much does the solution fulfill the requirements of the project?
    - How is the performance of the solution?
    - Are the necessary integrations and use of third party libraries done wisely?
- #### `2.` Code Quality Scoring
    - ##### `2.1.` The architecture and design of the project
        - How good are the folders, files, classes and functions placed in the project?
        - Does the project follow a certain architectural paradigm or is it designed arbitrarily?
        
    - ##### `2.2.` Readability 
        - How is the naming done? Do the classes, functions and variables self-explanatory?
        - Is there a documentation, is it satisfactory?
        - Are the comments too much, too less or placed when they are needed?
        - Is the code formatted, aligned properly? Is the whitespace used wisely?
    - ##### `2.3.` Modularity and Maintainability
        - Is the [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) principle applied to the project?
        - How suitable is the project with [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)) principles?
    - ##### `2.4.` Algorithms and Data Structures
        - How optimal are the algorithms used in the project?
        - Are the data structures selected wisely and purposefully?
